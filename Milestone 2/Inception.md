Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    We intend on using the Agile methodology to devlop our project and implementing the Scrum framework to achieve our goals. 
    We will be developing in 2 week sprints in order to focus on the most important features first and to allow for flexibility in our development process.
    This will emphasize the importance of communication and collaboration between team members while allowing us to be flexible with our plan in response to events or changes that occur in the development process.
    
    What processes are we following?  How will we run this project? ==> Agile, Scrum, ...      What are we choosing to do, how will we do it and at what level of detail or extent?

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    Summarize what was discussed.  What do they want? Include:

### Description of Clients/Users

### List of Stakeholders and their Positions (if applicable)
    (Stakeholders pulled from Milestone2.md)
    Development Team Members - The development team will be responsible for the creation of the application. They will be responsible for the design, implementation, and testing of the application. They will also be responsible for the documentation of the application.
    Tournament Organizers - The tournament organizers will be responsible for the creation of tournaments with our application. They will be able to create tournaments, add players to tournaments, and update the status of tournaments. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the applications unique features the most in a techincal/admin role. 
    Gamers - Gamers will be able to use the application to find tournaments to participate in. They will be able to view the status of tournaments and see what tournaments are upcoming. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the application the most from a registered user role.
    Spectators - Spectators will be able to use the application to view the status of tournaments and see what tournaments are upcoming, along with being able to see a place to watch the tournament. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the application the most from a casual user role.
    Sponsors - Sponsors will be able to see what tournaments can be sponsored and will be able to contact the tournament organizers to sponsor a tournament. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the application the most from a business role.
    Who are they? Why are they a stakeholder?

## Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation
    See Requirements_template for more
    (from Requirements_template.md)
    1. Is the goal or outcome well defined?  Does it make sense?
    2. What is not clear from the given description?
    3. How about scope?  Is it clear what is included and what isn't?
    4. What do you not understand?
            * Technical domain knowledge
            * Business domain knowledge
    5. Is there something missing?
    6. Get answers to these questions.

### Elicitation Questions
    (questions above are the primary questions to ask, these are secondary questions that may help refine the answers to the primary questions)
    1. What are the main goals of the project?
    2. What are the main features of the project?
    3. Why are these features important?
    4. What are the main use cases of the project?
    5. What kind of users will be using the project?
    6. Why use this project over other similar projects? What makes this project unique?
