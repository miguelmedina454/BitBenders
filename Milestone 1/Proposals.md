## Project Proposal #1: Space Explorer's Hub

### Description: 

Create an engaging web platform for space enthusiasts, combining educational resources, real-time space data, and community-driven content. Users can access NASA's API to explore space imagery, astronomy data, and upcoming astronomical events. The application will also include a discussion forum for users to share their knowledge and insights. Additionally, integration with SendGrid can provide email notifications for new forum posts and events.

## Project Proposal #2: Fast In-Store Product(s) Look-up Webapp

### Description: 

This application would allow users to quickly scan products in a store or otherwise using a camera. Unlike barcode scanning apps, the user would simply take a picture in-app of any product or products and the app will automatically tell which product it is and report back to the user information about the product, most prominently ratings/reviews and maybe nurtrional facts. If you take a picture of multiple products, it will tell you which products are rated the highest or perhaps are the healthiest. This would be done by AI image recognition technology that will identify the products, seperate them if multiple, and then we could use APIs to search and pull information about the product from a google api or other online stores.

## Project Proposal #3: Calorie Tracker / Diet Planner / Food Journal

### Description: 

This app would allow the user to take a picture of food items and then the app would use AI image recognition to identify the food and then pull information about the food from an API. The user would then be able to add the food to a list of foods they have eaten that day and the app would keep track of the calories and other nutritional information. The user would be able to set a daily calorie goal and the app would keep track of how many calories they have eaten that day and how many they have left. Ideally the user would be able to set nutritional and weight goals with this information that the app would be able to make suggestions for. The app would also allow the user to search for foods and add them to their list manually if they do not have or find a picture of their food while also being able to save it for easier access in the future.

## Project Proposal #4: Smart Bracket app

### Description: 

This application streamlines competitive bracket management, offering easy and efficient control. It employs a smart seeding algorithm, allowing users to seed brackets based on initial data and adjust for conflicts. The algorithm provides a bracket integrity percentage, indicating how changes affect seeding. The app includes a smart assistant analyzing player match times, optimizing scheduling for efficiency. Additional features comprise notifying players of official seeding changes, considering player conflicts, and enabling match broadcasting based on popularity of user interaction. API's considered for this application include [StartggAPI](https://developer.start.gg/docs/intro/), [ChallongeAPI](https://transparent-pen-8a5.notion.site/Challonge-Connect-Documentation-ab016fd6b875474b9b67b9d8f8590497), [ChatGPT&WhisperAPI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis).
